1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

    - React JS is a JavaScript library that is used to build user interfaces. Instead of starting your application from scratch, you can use React to build Applications, Stateful Components, and the ability to use additional frameworks such as Reactstrap.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

    - To think in react is to plan ahead for components and their uses for your application. Sometimes, this will change during production, but it's good to start off this way. Also, if you start to repeat code, that would also be a good opportunity to code a new component.

3. Describe state.

    - State is what allows you to build components that are dynamic, or interactive.

4. Describe props.

    - Props is short for properties, and unlike state, props can only hold immutable data. You can think of props as a parameter.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

    - Side effects are either intended or not. Some examples for side effects are changing the DOM and fetching data from an API using the useEffect hook with axios.
